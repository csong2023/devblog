> reference: Bruno Bonnechère et al. 2021. **Brain training using cognitive apps can improve cognitive performance and processing speed in older adults**

## Introduction

- Users who trained with the games improved regardless of age in terms of scores and processing speed throughout the 100 sessions, suggesting that old and very old adults can improve their cognitive performance using CMG in real-life use.
- According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the world population aged over 60 years will have doubled in number by 2050, with an estimated total of 2 billion people. `WHO.AgeingandHealth(WHO,2018).`

## Result

- Statistically significant dif- ferences were observed for the different CMG (p<0.001) and within the CMG for the different age groups for Memory Sweep (p = 0.013), Babble Bots (p < 0.001) and Unique (p < 0.001).

## Discussion

- Though the changes in different cognitive abilities over the lifespan are relatively well-documented , there is less evidence on the plasticity of these different cognitive functions across the lifespan 23–25. Furthermore, it has not yet been established whether all cognitive functions can be trained or the extent to which progress can be achieved in healthy subjects of different ages.
